# XPANDA
PAND of GNSS in python or Julia.

This is a program that I created to convert the known GNSS software PANDA to a modern Language like Python or Julia, originaly FORTRAN.

The purpose is to speed up the data process and try to perform the main process on the GPU instead of CPU. Someone already did this, I just creat this program for fun, and I'm not hoping to finish this. If FORTRAN can run on GPU or I have to use CUDA language, that's fine, This is just a begining, and just an idea, nothing is planned or promised by now (9/28/2024).
